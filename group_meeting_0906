- Joshua: simulations in OSIRIX: not possible to add electrons in wakefield, for phase 2
    Konstantin told that it would also be a problem to simulate those with LCODE, but think it would work.

- Possibility of getting computer time in LRZ or RZG discussed, likely possible

- Google Calendar to ask Patric schedule and also mark group meetings (send Joshua email informing)

Difference between plasma + excited vapor and plasma


Fabi
- Who is Veronica?

Check units of stopping power
15 MEv electrons (more or less) from electron gun
A lot bigger than binding energy

=> NExt steps
Give list of electrons generated (position, number, velocity distribution, energy) and give Erdem
create momentum electron azymuthal simmetry

Simulate with experimental parameters

ppt => Say vacancies created during WHAT distance

Nicolas
- Look at Dumps, the curves should look the same (try fitting)
